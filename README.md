# How it works
* The program generates a random camera view around a sphere or cube in order to guess the lines that form it.
* The shapes have a fisheye type deformation, and the closer it is to the camera the greater the deformation it will have and the further away the less
* The user's objective is to draw lines on the screen and try to guess the lines of the shape, which by default are hidden and can be unhidden by pressing the space key.
